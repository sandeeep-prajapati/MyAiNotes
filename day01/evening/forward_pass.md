Forward Pass:

The forward pass is a process in a neural network where input data flows through the network, layer by layer, to produce an output. It's called a "pass" because the data passes through the network in a single iteration.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the forward pass:

1. Input Layer: The input data is fed into the network, and it becomes the input to the first layer.
2. Hidden Layers: The input data is processed by each hidden layer, using the weights and biases learned during training. The output of each hidden layer becomes the input to the next layer.
3. Output Layer: The output of the last hidden layer is processed by the output layer to produce the final output of the network.
4. Activation Functions: Each layer applies an activation function to the output, introducing non-linearity to the network. Common activation functions include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.
5. Output: The final output of the network is produced, which can be a classification label, a regression value, or a probability distribution.

In PyTorch, the forward pass is defined in the forward method of a neural network module (subclass of nn.Module). The forward method takes the input data as input and returns the output of the network.

Example:

class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))  # hidden layer
        x = self.fc2(x)  # output layer
        return x

In this example, the forward method defines the forward pass through the network. The input x is processed by the hidden layer (fc1 and relu), and then by the output layer (fc2). The final output is returned.

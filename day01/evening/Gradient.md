Gradient Descent:

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function in machine learning. It's a first-order optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts the model's parameters to find the values that minimize the loss.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of gradient descent:

1. Initialize parameters: Set the initial values of the model's parameters.
2. Compute loss: Calculate the loss between the predicted output and the actual output.
3. Compute gradients: Calculate the gradients of the loss with respect to each parameter.
4. Update parameters: Update the parameters by subtracting the product of the gradient and the learning rate.
5. Repeat: Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence or a stopping criterion is reached.

Gradient descent can be used for both batch and stochastic optimization. In batch optimization, the gradients are computed using the entire training dataset, while in stochastic optimization, the gradients are computed using a single training example.

Types of Gradient Descent:

1. Batch Gradient Descent: Computes gradients using the entire training dataset.
2. Stochastic Gradient Descent: Computes gradients using a single training example.
3. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent: Computes gradients using a small batch of training examples.

PyTorch Implementation:

# Define the model and loss function
model = Net()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Define the optimizer
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Train the model
for epoch in range(10):
    for x, y in trainloader:
        # Compute loss
        output = model(x)
        loss = criterion(output, y)

        # Compute gradients
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()

        # Update parameters
        optimizer.step()

In this example, the SGD optimizer is used to update the model's parameters using gradient descent. The zero_grad method is used to reset the gradients, and the backward method is used to compute the gradients. The step method is used to update the parameters.

Tensors in PyTorch

In PyTorch, a tensor is a multi-dimensional array of numerical values used to represent data. Tensors are the fundamental data structure in PyTorch, similar to NumPy arrays, but with additional features and optimizations for deep learning.

Basic Operations on Tensors

Here are some basic operations you can perform on tensors in PyTorch:

1. Creation:
    - torch.tensor(data) : Creates a tensor from a Python list or numpy array.
    - torch.Tensor(*size) : Creates an uninitialized tensor with the given size.
2. Indexing:
    - tensor[index] : Access a specific element or slice of the tensor.
3. Basic Math:
    - tensor + other : Element-wise addition.
    - tensor - other : Element-wise subtraction.
    - tensor * other : Element-wise multiplication.
    - tensor / other : Element-wise division.
4. Matrix Multiplication:
    - tensor @ other : Matrix multiplication (requires compatible shapes).
5. Reshaping:
    - tensor.view(*shape) : Reshapes the tensor to the given shape.
6. Transpose:
    - tensor.t() : Transposes the tensor (swaps rows and columns).
7. Concatenation:
    - torch.cat((tensor1, tensor2), dim=0) : Concatenates two tensors along the specified dimension.
8. Element-wise Operations:
    - torch.abs(tensor) : Element-wise absolute value.
    - torch.sin(tensor) : Element-wise sine.
    - torch.relu(tensor) : Element-wise ReLU activation function.

These operations are essential for building and manipulating tensors in PyTorch. You can explore more advanced operations and functions in the PyTorch documentation.

Example:

import torch

# Create a tensor
x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])

# Basic math operations
y = x + 2  # [3, 4, 5]
z = x * 2  # [2, 4, 6]

# Matrix multiplication
A = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = torch.tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
C = A @ B  # [[19, 22], [43, 50]]

# Reshaping and transpose
x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4])
x = x.view(2, 2)  # [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
x = x.t()  # [[1, 3], [2, 4]]

# Django Media File Handling - Lecture Notes

**0:00 - Introduction**
- Introduction to the lecture on handling file uploads in Django.
- Overview of the key concepts to be covered:
  - Handling file uploads using `request.FILES`
  - Encoding forms for multipart data
  - Testing file upload functionality

**2:23 - Add `request.FILES` to `update_venue`**
- Explanation of the `request.FILES` attribute in Django.
- How to use `request.FILES` in the `update_venue` view to handle file uploads.
- Example:
  ```python
  def update_venue(request, venue_id):
      venue = get_object_or_404(Venue, pk=venue_id)
      if request.method == 'POST':
          form = VenueForm(request.POST, request.FILES, instance=venue)
          if form.is_valid():
              form.save()
              return redirect('venue_detail', venue_id=venue.id)
      else:
          form = VenueForm(instance=venue)
      return render(request, 'update_venue.html', {'form': form})
  ```

**3:24 - Add Multipart Form-Data Encoding to Form**
- Importance of setting the `enctype` attribute to `multipart/form-data` in the HTML form for file uploads.
- Example in HTML:
  ```html
  <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      {% csrf_token %}
      {{ form.as_p }}
      <button type="submit">Save</button>
  </form>
  ```

**3:55 - Test It Out**
- Steps to test the file upload functionality:
  - Navigate to the update venue page.
  - Select an image file to upload.
  - Submit the form and check if the image is uploaded successfully.
  - Verify the image is saved correctly in the media directory and associated with the venue instance.
- Tips for troubleshooting common issues:
  - Ensure `MEDIA_URL` and `MEDIA_ROOT` are correctly configured in `settings.py`.
  - Check the form's encoding type and ensure the view is handling `request.FILES`.
